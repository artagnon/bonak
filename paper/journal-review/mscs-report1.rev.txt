The paper presents a Coq formalisation of ν-sets which are a generalisation of
augmented semi-simplicial (ν=1) and semi-cubical (ν=2) sets. I have reviewed
the previous version of the paper, and this new version is certainly improved.
In particular, the title was changed to clarify that we work in a setting with
(local) UIP, there is a link to the formalisation, there is a description of
dependent streams, and there are several small improvements. The description of
the formalisation is well-structured and helpful with multiple iterations, each
getting closer to the actual code.

The Coq formalisation typechecks. The file νType.v has some examples at the
end. It would be very nice to have more examples which actually compute to
something human readable: I tried printing the 3-dimensional version of
SemiSimplicial2, but the type of triangles is too complicated to be
human-readable. I guess this should not be too hard as the coherence equations
are all refl for finite unfoldings.

The paper contributes a new indexed definition of semi-cubical sets and their
generalisations. Previous formalisations were more specific or were not on the
indexed, but on the fibred side of the indexed family/fibration correspondence.
The paper is well written, well-motivated, cites the relevant related work, and
is supported by a well-documented Coq formalisation. I suggest acceptance.

Thanks for your new comments. We list below the changes we made to address your remarks.

Best regards,

We don't feel comfortable about not considering Part and Luo's formalization as
a formalization of semi-simplicial types. In order to avoid taking a position,
we say that Part and Luo as well as Altenkirch et. al. are both "stated as
providing semi-simplicial types (thanks to an extension of the type theory)",
without commenting on whether they should be considered as such or not. Would
this be ok?

Ah, yes: thanks for catching this! We have fixed the text at the bottom of p6,
and chosen to tweak Definition 4.

We had caught and fixed this earlier, but sent the wrong version by mistake. We
have sent the correct version now.

Fixed now, thanks.

Fixed, thanks.

Fixed, thanks. It is displayed as "PhD thesis" now, from the @phdthesis bib
entry.

Fixed, thanks.

Fixed now, thanks.

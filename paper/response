Thanks a lot for the reviews.

Some comments are about local parts of the paper and we have taken them into account in a new version of the paper that can be found on the publication page of the web site of the first author.

Other comments are about stating contributions more explicitly and we also took them into account in the new version of paper.

An important part of the comments is about the structure of the paper and about the explanation strategy. We have been able to take several suggestions into account but it would be unreasonable for us to deeply reorganize the paper at this stage, all the more that we are unsure that such a reorganization would be appreciated by all kinds of readers. Instead, considering each comment one by one, we did our best to prevent the reader to be lost in explanations by adding text that we hope clarifies the structure of the paper.

We otherwise conclude the response with answers to specific points.

# Local comments easy to take into account

This includes in particular:
- replacing "flavor" with a more precise word ("has the structure of a cubical / augmented simplicial set")
- using passive form rather than "we" when not a contribution
- "obtained by applying simple rules characterizing iterated parametricity" -> "generated by iterating the parametricity translation for type judgements"
- incorporating section numbers in the outline
- our precise mechanization in Coq -> our mechanization
- notation \hat{delta} for the semi-simplex category: this is Greg Friedman's terminology but it is accordingly confusing, we removed
- using of square brackets rather than curly brackets for sequences
- making explicit the dimension of standard augmented semi-simplices and semi-cubes
- making explicit that there is no augmentation in semi-cubical sets
- making explicit that the nu-set functor is contravariant
- explaining on page 4 from where come the coherence conditions
- explaining that frames and νsets^{<n} are nesting of ∑-types (telescopes)
- clarify "the nth component is a family ..."
- give name "Main definition" to table 1
- clarify where in the text the mutual recursion is left implicit
- clarify that it is the applied arguments that are all made explicit in the second group of tables
- various typographical or grammatical issues (especially a "-1" missing twice page 6 in frame{n,p}, as questioned by reviewer 2)
- adding a comment explaining how the n-components of standard semi-simplices and semi-cubes can be oriented (as suggested by reviewer 2)
- fixing/updating the bibliography
- clarifying the definitional issues in the conclusion (now also in the introduction)

# Contributions

We added in the introduction a paragraph stating what we consider to be our main contributions:
- a recipe for parametricity iterated in all dimensions defined in full details
- another case study in defining indexed augmented semi-simplicial and semi-cubical sets, especially regarding the question of how to deal with coherence conditions (indirectly helping to understand semi-simplicial types)
- an indexed alternative to presheaf models of parametric and cubical type theories

We are not aware of a reference for our uniform definition of augmented semi-simplicial and cubical sets, but, as an answer to reviewers 1 and 2, we suspect that this is folklore. For instance, this seems known from reviewer 3 whose review says that a definition (morally) identical to ours is their favorite definition (assuming that the type of their second constructor has a typo and should be read ""m <= n -> succ m <= succ n").

We also follow reviewer 2 in considering that the purpose of the definition of nu-sets is before all to generalize the two cases of augmented semi-simplicial and cubical sets. We are thus a bit hesitant at repeating it a third time even though we are not aware of the concept being spelled out in the literature.

# Organization of the paper

## Scope of sections III and IV

As suggested, we removed the discussion about fibered/indexed in set theory, we also removed the useless reference to Grothendieck's construction and inlined section III.B in former III.C.

As suggested, we merged IV.A with III.C (or rather, III.B and III.C being merged, IV.A becomes III.C)

## Order of presentation between intuitions and formal definitions

One reason for having chosen to give intuitions first is that in our experience, the formal definitions are perceived as very technical and very difficult to grasp without help.

On the other side, we agree that it is not so helpful either to give intuitions without explaining also to which formal definition we are heading.

As a compromise, we have added text explaining the structure of Sections III and IV, explaining where the formal explanations are, and clarifying that the intuitions can be read in parallel with the tables formally defining the construction.

# Other issues or questions

## Miscellaneous clarifications in the text

> Then explain that for X an augmented semi simplicial set, (IIUC) X0 is pictured as a set of colors,

Colors alone have no geometric representation. Only points, lines, etc. are pictured, and, when pictured, with "literally" using a color (such as red, green, ... though in our case, it is black).

> those drawings with no clear explanations as to how they connect to the fullframe3 type does not improve the understanding of the reader

It is unclear to us how to make the explanations following the drawings clearer.

> The first two table should be swapped as the first one uses definitions in the second one.

We prefer to keep Table I first because this is the main "entry point" to the construction.

> Why not just explaining this definition in ITT [only]

We prefer to keep the section on ETT because it shows how reasoning in ETT is similar to reasoning in set theory, with equality holding implicitly "in the air". In particular, it seems to us that the construction better fits the "mathematical" way of thinking when expressed in ETT. We told this in the new introduction (but we would need more time to explain it also in the corresponding sections).

> I suspect it is tied to your "type theory in color" (G. Moulin) references

Colors in our definition are unrelated to colors in Moulin (in Moulin, colors are dimensions, for us, it is a tagging of points).

> "coinductive limit" is a non standard term. I believe what you mean is a filtered colimit

We don't think that a ν-set is a colimit. It is a stream, nesting ∑-types countably many times, thus a limit. Formulated in a fibered way, it would be a (co)filtered limit but it is in indexed form, so it seems to us that talking about coinductive limit makes sense, even if not a standard terminology. What about the following alternative: "it is a stream, coinductively representing the limit of $n$-truncated $\nu$-sets"?

> Condensing the paragraphs starting with "The entire construction relies on inequalities over natural numbers, ..."

How to deal at the same time with the inductive, computational and proof-irrelevant aspects of inequalities over natural numbers is a crucial issue in the formalization which may somehow deserve a paper in itself. Even if not developed in all details, it seems to us important to hint at the importance of such issues.

## Semi-simplicial (or semi-cubical) types in general

> It seems that the construction on types could be developed in a 2-level type theory as in [1].

The paper does not contribute anything special to the question of semi-simplicial or semi-cubical types in general. However, we are indeed confident that the relaxing from HSets to types in our construction could be developed in a 2-level type theory.

About degeneracies, we did not think deeply about it but Kraus-Sattler is a good reference which we added to the discussion in the introduction.

## Comments that we expect to address at some time

> I suggest you begin the section [II.A] with the "While ordinary semi-simplicial" paragraph

That is a possibility but we need more time to think about it.

> I think some more detail on the relationship between this work and Herbelin 2015 would be useful for unfamilar readers.

We agree. Shortly, Herbelin 2015 organizes the boundary of a n-simplex as a nested ∑-type of length n whose p-th component is the collection of the faces of dimension p of the n-simplex while the paper organizes the boundary of a n-simplex as a nested ∑-type of length n whose p-th component is a (n-p)-dimensional cube living between dimension p and dimension n. In particular, in the paper, the faces are not ordered by their dimension but structurally, by the dimension of the subcube they live in, according to the decomposition shown page 6 in the picture with blue, red and green faces of a 3-cube.

# Miscellaneous

There are also comments which we are unsure to be able to understand what they ask:
- ``The phrasing "is a singleton of one color" is inaccurate''
- ``"More generally, the standard augmented": refer explicitly to the above triangle''

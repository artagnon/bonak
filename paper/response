Thanks a lot for the reviews.

Part of the comments are about local parts of the paper and we have
taken them into account in a new version of the paper that can be
found on the publication page of the web site of the first author.

This includes:
- replacing "flavor" with a precise word ("has the structure of a cubical / augmented simplicial set")
- using passive form rather than "we" when not a contribution
- "obtained by applying imple rules characterizing iterated parametricity" -> "generated by iterating the parametricity translation for type judgements"
- incorporating section numbers in the outline
- our precise mechanization in Coq -> our mechanization
- notation \hat{delta} for the semi-simplex category: this is Greg Friedman's terminology but it is accordingly confusing, we removed
- use of square brackets rather than curly brackets for sequences
- make explicit the dimension of standard augmented semi-simplices and semi-cubes
- make explicit that there is no augmentation in semi-cubical sets
- make explicit that the nu-set functor is contravariant
- explain from where come the coherence conditions on page 4
- explain that frames are telescopes and that νsets^{<n} abbreviate telescopes

TODO: while ordinary ...

Another part of the comments are about our contributions not being
stated explicitly enough and about a wrong explanation strategy
in articulating the intuitions and the detailed definitions.

## Contributions

We added in the introduction a paragraph stating what we consider are our contributions:
- a recipe for parametricity iterated in all dimensions defined in full details
- another case study in defining indexed augmented semi-simplicial and semi-cubical sets, especially regarding the question of how to deal with coherence conditions (indirectly helping to understand semi-simplicial types)
- an alternative to presheaf models of parametric and cubical type theories

We are not aware of a reference for our uniform definition of augmented semi-simplicial and cubical sets but we suspect that this is folklore. For instance, this seems known from reviewer 3 whose review says that a definition (morally) identical to ours is their favorite definition (assuming that the type of the second constructor has a typo and should be read ""m <= n -> succ m <= succ n").

We also follow reviewer 2 in considering that the purpose of the definition of nu-sets is only to generalize the two cases of augmented semi-simplicial and cubical sets. We are thus a bit hesitant at repeating it a third time even though we are not aware of the concept being spelled out in the literature.

### Scope of sections III and IV

- as suggested, we removed the discussion about fibered/indexed in set theory, we also removed the useless reference to Grothendieck's construction and inline section III.B in former III.C
- as suggested, we merged IV.A with III.C (or rather, III.B and III.C being merged, IV.A becomes III.C)

### Order of presentation between intuitions and formal definitions

One reason for having chosen to give intuitions first is that in our experience, the formal definitions are perceived as very technical and impossible to understand without help.

On the other side, we agree that it is not helpful to give intuitions without explaining also where we are going.

As a compromise, we have added text explaining the structure of Section III and IV, explaining where the formal explanations are, and clarifying that the intuitions can be read in parallel with the tables formally defining the construction.

### Other issues

Here are clarifications on some questions:

- Then explain that for X an augmented semi simplicial set, (IIUC) X0 is pictured as a set of colors,

Colors alone have no geometric representation. Only points, lines, etc. are pictured, and, when pictured, with "literally" using a color (such as red, green, ... though in our case, it is black).

We kept the drawing in Section 4 which seems to be useful.

We prefer to keep the section on ETT because it shows how reasoning in ETT is similar to reasoning in set theory, with equality holding implicitly "in the air". In particular, the construction is less frightening when expressed in ETT.

We prefer to keep Table I first because this is the main "entry point" to the construction.

We don't think that a ν-set is a colimit. It is a stream, thus a limit. Formulated in a fibered way, it would be a (co)filtered limit but it is in indexed form, so it seems to us that talking about coinductive limit is appropriate. We remain open to the discussion though.

There are also comments which we did not understand:
- The phrasing "is a singleton of one color" is inaccurate
- "More generally, the standard augmented" -> refer explicitly to the above triangle
